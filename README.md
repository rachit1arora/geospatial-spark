# geospatial-spark

Geospatial data plays a crucial role in data forecasting, spatial analytics, and reporting, especially in the fields of logistics and finance. Additionally, there are increasingly more use cases where technologies like artificial intelligence have been used in tandem with geospatial applications.
Apache Spark is an open source, scalable, massively parallel, in-memory execution engine for analytics applications. Apache Spark also includes prebuilt machine-learning algorithms and graph analysis algorithms that are especially written to execute in parallel and in memory. It also supports interactive SQL processing of queries and real-time streaming analytics. As a result, you can write analytics applications in programming languages such as Java, Python, R and Scala.

Spark Offering in IBM Cloud Pak for Data also known as Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark/ IBM Watson Studio Spark environments offer additional Algorithms built specially to do analytics in parallel and in memory. One of such additional algorithms which are offered in Analytics Engine is the domain of  Geospatial. These Algorithms have been built in collaboration with IBM Research and can be used for solving many analytical use cases. The purpose of this blog is to share a scenario where you use Geospatial algorithm in Apache Spark.

This git repo contain some code examples which we show how Geospatial algorithms fron Analytics Engine can be used.
